Extended a Jira-inspired task management platform (Redberry Website) with task commenting and status update functionality. Integrated RESTful API endpoints to fetch and submit comments in real time, allowing team members to collaborate efficiently within each task. Built reusable React components with TypeScript for managing comments and task interactions. While the platform is not yet responsive for mobile devices, the focus was placed on functional accuracy, smooth user interaction, and maintaining a consistent desktop experience.
